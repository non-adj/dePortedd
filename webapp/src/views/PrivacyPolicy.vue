    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      DePortedd may rely on third-party services for map data and functionality. If you choose to interact with these services, such as submitting a report or viewing embedded content, you may be subject to their privacy policies. Please refer to those third-party privacy policies for details on their data practices.

    <h2>3. User Submissions</h2>

      If you submit a report of a student visa revocation or deportation, your submission is kept confidential and is only used for the purpose of review and possible inclusion on our public map. We do not share your information with third parties unless required by law.
