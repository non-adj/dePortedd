        ALPRs Do Not Reduce Crime
      </v-expansion-panel-title>
      <v-expansion-panel-text>
        <p>
          There&apos;s no independent research proving that ALPRs can reduce crime. Headlines and supporting studies claiming otherwise are often produced by the companies selling ALPRs and the police agencies buying them.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, Flock Safety claims that <a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/articles/10-of-reported-crime-in-the-u-s-is-solved-using-flock-technology" target="_blank">10% of Reported Crime in the U.S. Is Solved Using Flock Technology.</a> The study that Flock cites was conducted by two Flock employees and “given legitimacy with the &apos;oversight&apos; of two academic researchers whose names are also on the paper” according to <a href="https://www.404media.co/researcher-who-oversaw-flock-surveillance-study-now-has-concerns-about-it/" target="_blank">a report by 404 Media</a>. Flock Safety is using the veneer of an academic study as part of its sales pitch.

          What research does exist regarding the ability of ALPRs to reduce crime is inconclusive at best:

          Our findings indicate that, when small numbers of LPR patrols are used in crime hot spots in the way we have tested them here, they do not seem to generate either a general or offense-specific deterrent effect.

        ALPRs Are Dragnet Surveillance
      </v-expansion-panel-title>
      <v-expansion-panel-text>

        <p>
          A study of ALPRs in Piedmont, CA, found that <b>less than 0.3%</b> of ALPR hits might translate into a useful investigative lead. Most license plates recorded were not on a hot list, yet police still logged information on people's movements throughout the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flock Safety provides Transparency Portals to their police customers, which allow the public to see the data collected by ALPRs. From these portals, we can see that the vast majority of license plates scanned are not on a hot list (vehicles suspected of being involved in crimes). For example:

        ALPRs Are Abused

      <v-expansion-panel-text>
        <p>
          There are many documented cases where police have knowingly used ALPRs to commit crimes and put people in danger. These examples illustrate that it can be difficult to put meaningful restrictions in place that prevent ALPRs from being used for nefarious purposes. It's often only after harm is done that an officer is caught and punished, if at all.
